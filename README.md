## Usage

Provide instructions on how to run the code and perform analyses.

## Methodology

The project employs a sequence of analytical steps, including:

- **Data Preparation**: Involves preprocessing and cleaning of the building-level energy data.
- **Spatial Discretization**: Defines spatial units by dividing the study area into grid cells of variable size.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Calculates global and local entropies based on energy demand at each spatial scale.
- **Optimal Scale Identification**: Determines the spatial scale that maximizes information preservation using entropy-based metrics.

## Data
